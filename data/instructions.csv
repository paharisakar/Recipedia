Remove from heat and slowly whisk in the heavy cream. Once cream and chocolate are well mixed, fold in the pecan butter.

Place in fridge for at least 6 hours before using. NOTE: I only use half of this for each cake, so I freeze the other half to use again. It freezes well in an airtight container and I have used it up to 6 months later.

In a small bowl, melt dark chocolate. To do this I place in microwave on 50% power in 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval. Once melted and smooth, repeat with white chocolate.

Use a mixer with paddle attachment to beat together water, sour cream, oil, extracts and egg whites until well combined.

In a separate bowl, whisk together cake mix, flour, sugar, and salt.

Turn mixer to low. Slow beat cake/flour mixture into sour cream/egg mixture.

Beat on low for 3-4 minutes. Some lumps will remain.

Divide batter into 3 bowls. 1/4 of the batter should go into one small bowl and remaining batter should be divided evenly between two medium sized bowls. Use blue food coloring to color batter in smaller bowl until desired color is reached. Use red food coloring to color batter in one of the larger bowl until desired color is reached. Leave the third bowl white.

Pour blue batter into one of the prepared 8"" pans. Pour 2/3 of red batter into one of the 8"" pans and the remaining 1/3 into one of the 6"" pans. Pour 2/3 of white batter into the final 8"" pan and the remaining 1/3 into the remaining 6"" pan.

Bake for 23-28 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out with just a few crumbs. The thicker cakes will take 25-28 minutes while the smaller cakes will take 23-25 minutes. I put them all in at the same time and check after 23 minutes

Cool cakes in pans for at least 5 minutes, then remove to racks to finish cooling. Let cool completely before assembling.

Thaw raspberries and strain juice from berries. For this step I put a large strainer over a bowl and let the berries thaw in the strainer.

Add enough water to the juice in the bowl so that you have 3/4 cup of liquid.

Combine juice mixture with sugar, lemon juice, and cornstarch in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens. Once mixture thickens, remove from heat and set aside.

Place the raspberries in a mesh strainer. Place strainer over bowl and press berries with spoon so that pulp falls into a bowl. Strain until you have 1/2 cup of pulp.

Once the mixture in the saucepan has cooled, add the raspberry pulp and raspberry liqueur. Stir well. Transfer to airtight contained and place in refrigerate for at least 3 hours before using.

Place butter and shortening in bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until mixture is smooth and has lightened in color.

Mix in powdered sugar 1/2 cup at a time. Start on low, then beat on high speed until well incorporated.

Add vanilla and sea salt. Mix until well combined.

Mix in milk or heavy cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is achieved.

Divide frosting into 3 bowls. Place 1/4 of frosting into one bowl and mix in blue food coloring until desired shade is reached. Place 1/4 of frosting into a second bowl and mix in red food coloring until desired shade is reached. Place remaining 1/2 of frosting into final bowl, you will leave this white.

Use sugar cookie recipe to make sugar cookies, and cut into stars. If you don't want to make sugar cookies, you could use store bought dough and decorate with the royal frosting. I much prefer the homemade though!

Once cakes have cooled completely, level tops of all cakes. Use a cake leveler or knife to cut 8"" red cake, 8"" white cake in half (you will then have 4 thin 8"" cakes).

Put an empty 6"" pan in the center of the blue cake. Use a knife to gently press down around the pan so that you have an outline of the 6"" pan. Remove the pan and cut through the cake along the outline so that you can remove the center of the blue cake (you will not need the center you're cutting out, so you can use it as a snack while you decorate the rest of the cake).

Place one the 8"" red layers on a 10"" cake board. Use red frosting to pipe a border along the outside edge of the top of the cake. Fill inside the border with half of the raspberry filling.

Place an 8"" white layer on top of the raspberry filling. Cover layer with white frosting (I used a pasty bag with Wilton tip #12 for this).

Repeat with next red layer/remaining raspberry filling. Place final white layer on top of this, but do not cover with white frosting. Place red 6"" cake on center of white layer. With a Wilton tip #12, use blue frosting to pipe around the red layer. Then place blue layer on top of blue frosting.

Place final 6"" white layer inside of blue layer. For whichever layer is shorter, use corresponding color frosting to raise height to that of taller layer. My white was taller than my blue, so I used blue frosting to pipe on top of the blue cake so that the frosting was the same height as the white cake.

Divide your white, blue, and red frostings into three pastry bags. Use a Wilton #12, or similar round tip for all of the bags. Start at the bottom of the cake and pipe around the red layer with red frosting, the white layer with the white frosting, etc. Use the blue to color around the blue layer at the top. For the top of the cake pipe around the blue with blue and the middle white with white.

Use Ateco frosting smoother, or something similar, to go around outside of cake. Just holding the smoother while going around the cake will cause the colors to blend together beautifully. Wipe off the smoother and use it for the top of the cake as well.

Use the white frosting with the Wilton #12 tip to pipe 8 evenly spaced mounds on the top of the cake. Place a star cookie into each mound. You can also place mounds in the center for a larger cookie as well.

Change the frosting tip to a Wilton #21, or similar star tip, and pipe stars along the bottom outside of the cake.

Use sprinkles to decorate further as desired!

Pour in vanilla and stir until smooth.

Diving icing into number of bowls corresponding to number of colors you want to use.

I recommended adding 1-2 extra tbsp of powdered sugar to one of the bowls to make a thicker icing. This thicker icing is good for piping edges that you can let dry, and then flood the inside with a less viscous icing.

Add gel food coloring and mix until desired color is reached. NOTE: Liquid food coloring does NOT dry well, the icing comes out looking marbled.

Cover bowls with plastic wrap and let sit for at least 10 minutes to get the air bubbles out.

Icing can be applied using a pastry bag or bottles. I prefer Wilton 6oz squeeze bottles. NOTE: The icing can be tough to get into the bottles. Using a funnel with a tip as wide as can fit in the bottle opening is helpful.

If you are using more than one color, let the first one dry for 12-24 hours so the colors will not mix.

It is helpful to squeeze a thicker icing outline, then flood the center with icing. Working quickly, a spoon works well to spread it out, and a toothpick can help with fine details.

"
104,North Carolina Sourdough Bread,"
In a glass or plastic bowl, combine yeast and water. Cover and refrigerate for 3 to 5 days. Do not store in a container that has metal, and do not use a metal spoon to mix (I use a wooden spoon).

In a medium sized bowl, mix together sugar, potato flakes, and warm water. Combine with starter. Again, do not use metal container or spoon.

Let starter sit out at room temperature for 5 to 12 hours.

To make bread, take out 1 cup of the fed starter, and return the remaining starter to refrigerator. To keep the starter in the refrigerator alive for future bread, you need to feed it every 3 to 5 days. Each time you feed it, you need to either use 1 cup for bread, or throw out a cup (if you do not do this it will deplete your starter).

Alternatively, you can double the bread recipe, which is what I do. A double recipe uses almost of of the starter so you don't have to keep the rest going, or throw it out.

In a very large bowl, combine sugar, corn oil, salt, water water, bread flour, and one cup of fed starter. Again, do not use any bowls or utensils with metal.

Once the dough has come together into a stiff batter, spray another large bowl with cooking spray.

Place dough in prepared bowl and turn dough over so that all sides of dough are covered with spray.

Remove from heat and slowly whisk in the heavy cream. Once cream and chocolate are well mixed, fold in the pecan butter.

Place in fridge for at least 6 hours before using. NOTE: I only use half of this for each cake, so I freeze the other half to use again. It freezes well in an airtight container and I have used it up to 6 months later.

In a small bowl, melt dark chocolate. To do this I place in microwave on 50% power in 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval. Once melted and smooth, repeat with white chocolate.

Line three, 8″ round pans and two 6"" round pans with parchment paper. Grease and flour the sides (I use baking PAM for this).

Use a mixer with paddle attachment to beat together water, sour cream, oil, extracts and egg whites until well combined.

In a separate bowl, whisk together cake mix, flour, sugar, and salt.

Turn mixer to low. Slow beat cake/flour mixture into sour cream/egg mixture.

Beat on low for 3-4 minutes. Some lumps will remain.

Divide batter into 3 bowls. 1/4 of the batter should go into one small bowl and remaining batter should be divided evenly between two medium sized bowls. Use blue food coloring to color batter in smaller bowl until desired color is reached. Use red food coloring to color batter in one of the larger bowl until desired color is reached. Leave the third bowl white.

Pour blue batter into one of the prepared 8"" pans. Pour 2/3 of red batter into one of the 8"" pans and the remaining 1/3 into one of the 6"" pans. Pour 2/3 of white batter into the final 8"" pan and the remaining 1/3 into the remaining 6"" pan.

Bake for 23-28 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out with just a few crumbs. The thicker cakes will take 25-28 minutes while the smaller cakes will take 23-25 minutes. I put them all in at the same time and check after 23 minutes

Cool cakes in pans for at least 5 minutes, then remove to racks to finish cooling. Let cool completely before assembling.

Thaw raspberries and strain juice from berries. For this step I put a large strainer over a bowl and let the berries thaw in the strainer.

Add enough water to the juice in the bowl so that you have 3/4 cup of liquid.

Combine juice mixture with sugar, lemon juice, and cornstarch in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens. Once mixture thickens, remove from heat and set aside.

Divide frosting into 3 bowls. Place 1/4 of frosting into one bowl and mix in blue food coloring until desired shade is reached. Place 1/4 of frosting into a second bowl and mix in red food coloring until desired shade is reached. Place remaining 1/2 of frosting into final bowl, you will leave this white.

Use sugar cookie recipe to make sugar cookies, and cut into stars. If you don't want to make sugar cookies, you could use store bought dough and decorate with the royal frosting. I much prefer the homemade though!

Once cakes have cooled completely, level tops of all cakes. Use a cake leveler or knife to cut 8"" red cake, 8"" white cake in half (you will then have 4 thin 8"" cakes).

Put an empty 6"" pan in the center of the blue cake. Use a knife to gently press down around the pan so that you have an outline of the 6"" pan. Remove the pan and cut through the cake along the outline so that you can remove the center of the blue cake (you will not need the center you're cutting out, so you can use it as a snack while you decorate the rest of the cake).

Place one the 8"" red layers on a 10"" cake board. Use red frosting to pipe a border along the outside edge of the top of the cake. Fill inside the border with half of the raspberry filling.

Place an 8"" white layer on top of the raspberry filling. Cover layer with white frosting (I used a pasty bag with Wilton tip #12 for this).

Repeat with next red layer/remaining raspberry filling. Place final white layer on top of this, but do not cover with white frosting. Place red 6"" cake on center of white layer. With a Wilton tip #12, use blue frosting to pipe around the red layer. Then place blue layer on top of blue frosting.

Place final 6"" white layer inside of blue layer. For whichever layer is shorter, use corresponding color frosting to raise height to that of taller layer. My white was taller than my blue, so I used blue frosting to pipe on top of the blue cake so that the frosting was the same height as the white cake.

Divide your white, blue, and red frostings into three pastry bags. Use a Wilton #12, or similar round tip for all of the bags. Start at the bottom of the cake and pipe around the red layer with red frosting, the white layer with the white frosting, etc. Use the blue to color around the blue layer at the top. For the top of the cake pipe around the blue with blue and the middle white with white.

Use Ateco frosting smoother, or something similar, to go around outside of cake. Just holding the smoother while going around the cake will cause the colors to blend together beautifully. Wipe off the smoother and use it for the top of the cake as well.

Use the white frosting with the Wilton #12 tip to pipe 8 evenly spaced mounds on the top of the cake. Place a star cookie into each mound. You can also place mounds in the center for a larger cookie as well.

Change the frosting tip to a Wilton #21, or similar star tip, and pipe stars along the bottom outside of the cake.

Use sprinkles to decorate further as desired!

"
207,Buttermilk Biscuits,"
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and sugar.

Using a food processor with dough attachment, or a pastry cutter, cut butter and shortening into flour mixture. If you're using a food processor, using pulse about 3 times should be enough. If you're using a pastry cutter, do it just until it starts to look like very coarse crumbs.

Pour buttermilk into flour/butter mixture and mix until just combined. If you're using a food processor, a few pulses again should be enough.

Pour the mixture out onto a well floured surface.

Gently pat out the dough into a large circle, about 1-2"" thick, then fold the dough in half 3-5 times, until it just starts to come together. Gently pat the dough out into another large circle, about 1"" thick. NOTE: For this step I wear plastic gloves to help prevent the warmth of my hands from melting the butter, and because it's so messy.

Use a biscuit cutter to cut out as many biscuits as possible. Place these on an ungreased baking sheet, with the sides touching each other.

Gently push the remaining dough together to cut out more biscuits. Place these biscuits on the baking sheet, again with sides touching each other. NOTE: These biscuits will not be as fluffy as the first cut biscuits.

Bake for about 12 minutes, or until tops start to golden. Remove from oven and rub melted butter on tops of biscuits.

"
212,Sugar Cookies with Royal Icing,"
Preheat oven to 400.

Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

Beat in egg and extracts.

Mix flour, baking powder and salt; add to butter mixture 1 cup at a time, mixing after each addition.

Divide into two balls. On a floured surface roll to ⅛ “.

Dip cookie cutters into flour and use to cut out cookies.

Bake on ungreased cookie sheet 6-7 min or until lightly browned (I use a silicone mat on an AirBake sheet).

Let cookies cool on pan for 2-3 minutes. Remove and finish cooling on wire cooking rack.

Stir together powdered sugar and meringue powder. Gradually still in water.

Pour in vanilla and stir until smooth.

Diving icing into number of bowls corresponding to number of colors you want to use.

I recommended adding 1-2 extra tbsp of powdered sugar to one of the bowls to make a thicker icing. This thicker icing is good for piping edges that you can let dry, and then flood the inside with a less viscous icing.

Add gel food coloring and mix until desired color is reached. NOTE: Liquid food coloring does NOT dry well, the icing comes out looking marbled.

Cover bowls with plastic wrap and let sit for at least 10 minutes to get the air bubbles out.

Icing can be applied using a pastry bag or bottles. I prefer Wilton 6oz squeeze bottles. NOTE: The icing can be tough to get into the bottles. Using a funnel with a tip as wide as can fit in the bottle opening is helpful.

If you are using more than one color, let the first one dry for 12-24 hours so the colors will not mix.

It is helpful to squeeze a thicker icing outline, then flood the center with icing. Working quickly, a spoon works well to spread it out, and a toothpick can help with fine details.
"

"
214,North Carolina Sourdough Bread,"
In a glass or plastic bowl, combine yeast and water. Cover and refrigerate for 3 to 5 days. Do not store in a container that has metal, and do not use a metal spoon to mix (I use a wooden spoon).

In a medium sized bowl, mix together sugar, potato flakes, and warm water. Combine with starter. Again, do not use metal container or spoon.

Let starter sit out at room temperature for 5 to 12 hours.

To make bread, take out 1 cup of the fed starter, and return the remaining starter to refrigerator. To keep the starter in the refrigerator alive for future bread, you need to feed it every 3 to 5 days. Each time you feed it, you need to either use 1 cup for bread, or throw out a cup (if you do not do this it will deplete your starter).

Alternatively, you can double the bread recipe, which is what I do. A double recipe uses almost of of the starter so you don't have to keep the rest going, or throw it out.

In a very large bowl, combine sugar, corn oil, salt, water water, bread flour, and one cup of fed starter. Again, do not use any bowls or utensils with metal.

Once the dough has come together into a stiff batter, spray another large bowl with cooking spray.

Place dough in prepared bowl and turn dough over so that all sides of dough are covered with spray.

Cover bowl with a kitchen towel and let sit for 8-12 hours (overnight is perfect).

After 8-12 hours, punch down the dough and divide it into thirds.

On a floured surface, knead each third of dough 8 to 10 times.

Spray three loaf pans with cooking spraying and place dough in each of the pans.Turn dough over in prepared pan so that each side is coated with the cooking spray.

Cover pans with kitchen towel and let rise 5-8 hours.

Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes, or until tops are golden brown. Brush tops of bread with butter.

Then, add in turkey, flour, white wine, chicken stock, cumin, salt, tumeric, and lemon juice. Stir well. Simmer for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Once mixture has thickened, remove from heat.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

On a floured surface, roll out thawed puff pastry. There are two large pasty rectangles in each puff pasty box. Cut each of these rectangles horizontally and then vertically to make four smaller rectangles out of each large sheet. Use a rolling pin to roll each smaller section into a larger square shape that is about 1.5 times it's original size.

Fill each of the rectangles with 1/8 of the turkey and vegetable mixture. Fold pastry in half to make a triangle. Use your fingers to press all along the edges, sealing it closed.

Using a knife, place 1-2 small slits in the top of each pasty.

Sprinkle a small amount of cumin on top of each of the pastries. 

In a small bowl, whisk together 1 egg with 1 teaspoon of water. Use a brush to brush the egg wash on the top of each pasty.

Place pastries on an ungreased baking sheet (I use baking mats or parchment paper to help not to burn the bottoms, and for easier clean up). Bake for 30 minutes.
"
219,Lemon Strawberry Cake,"
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Line three, 8"" round pans with parchment paper. Flour and butter sides of pan (I use baking PAM for this).

Then, mix in sour cream until well combined.

Divide batter among three prepared pans and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until tops are golden and toothpick in center of cake comes out with just a few crumbs.

Let cool before removing from pans and frosting.

Put thawed strawberries in blender and puree until smooth. Will make about 1 3/4 cups. Place 3/4 cup in small sauce pan to use for filling. Set remaining puree aside until preparing frosting.

Add sugar, lemon juice and cornstarch to strawberries and small sauce pan. 

Heat over medium heat, whisking constantly, until sauce thickens, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat.

Squish enough strawberries to make 1/4 cup of strawberry chunks. I used my hands to do this part. Stir strawberry chunks into mixture in pot.

Transfer mixture to container with lid and put in fridge for at least 2 hours. 

Heat remaining strawberry puree in small sauce pan over medium heat, stirring frequently for about 20 minutes. 

Remove from heat and transfer to container with lid. Place container in fridge for at least 2 hours.

In large mixing bowl, beat together butter and shortening on medium-high until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. 

Beat in 1/2 cup powdered sugar, followed by 1 tablespoon cooled strawberry puree. Then beat in salt and vanilla. After this, add 1/2 powdered sugar and 1 tbsp strawberry puree at a time until desired consistency and strawberry taste is reached. You will likely not use all of the powdered sugar and puree.

Level cakes and place one layer on a cardboard round. 

Use frosting bag with large, round opening to pipe border around outside of cake. For this I use a #12 Wilton tip.


Fill inside of layer with half of cooled filling mixture.


Layer on second cake round and repeat. Place third layer on top.

Coat outside of cake with thin layer of frosting. Place cake in fridge for about 15-20 minutes.


Remove cake and finish frosting. I used the #12 tip to pipe the bottom of the cake and the frosting decor on top. Decorate with strawberries and lemon peel as desired.
